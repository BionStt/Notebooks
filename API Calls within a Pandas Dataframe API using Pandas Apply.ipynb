    "Whenever you're doing data analysis in Python your most likely using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) since it's widely used and, most importantly, one of the best tools available for data analytics. Even better, pandas is 100% open-source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is only as good as the data it is given. Good data in, good data out. Garbage in, garbage out. That's the ethos of many data scientists around the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have this amazing tool in Pandas, it's time we starting using another concept that you've probably heard of: APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs allow applications to automatically talk to one another, exchange data, and do so in a highly scalable and automated way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is going to show you a basic example of how you can use the [pandas apply](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html) method to enrich a dataframe with API data. \n",
