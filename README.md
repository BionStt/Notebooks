# CFE Notebooks
This repo is all about practical implementation of all kinds of coding. The goal is to provide a place for future blog posts, courses, projects, and more that don't need their own repo but rather just juypter notebooks running.

Enjoy!


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/Notebooks.git`

2. Create a virtual environment (either `pipenv`, `virtualenv`, or `venv`)

3. Install requirements (either with `pipenv` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

4. Run `jupyter notebook` within this repo.

5. Navigate to `src/` to find the notebooks.


## Notebooks
Various notebooks we're working on from either our blog ([cfe.sh/blog](https://cfe.sh/blog)) or as general research.

### [API Calls within a Pandas Dataframe API using Pandas Apply.ipynb](./src/API%20Calls%20within%20a%20Pandas%20Dataframe%20API%20using%20Pandas%20Apply.ipynb)
Doing an API call within pandas is awesome and helps enrich your data. Check it out with this notebook.

Topics include: pandas, python, jupyter, python requests, api calls

### [Multiple Category Classification with Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, & Python.ipynb](./src/API%20Calls%20within%20a%20Pandas%20Dataframe%20API%20using%20Pandas%20Apply.ipynb)
Classify text using a neural network in this notebook; we'll do a complex classification so it's more robust than a simple binary classification. There's not actually a lot to it. Let's take a look.

Topics include: keras, deep learning, neural networks, tensorflow, machine learning, python
